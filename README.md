# Titanic - Manual Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project implements logistic regression manually in Python using NumPy — without scikit-learn — on the Titanic dataset.

## Features:
- using scikit-learn logistic model
- Manual implementation of forward and backward propagation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent optimization
- Accuracy evaluation, classification report, confusion matrix
- Feature normalization and preprocessing

## Dataset
Based on Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Results
- Training Accuracy: 80%
- Test Accuracy: 80%
